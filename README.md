# DSA I Lab - Sorting Problem Solutions

## Overview

This repository contains problem sheets and solutions for sorting algorithms from the **DSA I Lab** course. The problems are designed for beginners and focus on basic sorting techniques.

## Structure

```

```

## How to Use

1. **Download or clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/rumman999/CSE2216_DSA_lab_UIU.git
   ```
2. **Open `sorting_problem_sheet.pdf`** to see the problems.
3. Navigate to the respective sorting algorithm folder to find solutions.
4. Each problem folder contains a `.cpp` file with a simple solution for beginners.

## Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++` for Linux/macOS, MinGW for Windows)
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

## Compilation & Execution

To compile and run a solution, navigate to the problem folder and use:

```sh
g++ problem01.cpp -o problem01
./problem01
```

Replace `problem01.cpp` with the appropriate file name for each problem.
